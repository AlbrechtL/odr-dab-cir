CIR scripts
===========

This is a set of script to do correlation measurement measurements
of a DAB signal. The goal is to one day do a channel impulse
response measurement.

Right now there are three scripts:

* simulate_channel.py: Reads an I/Q file generated by ODR-DabMod and
  adds some additional components, somehow equivalent to signal reflexions.
  Each reflexion has a delay and an amplitude factor.

* correlate_with_ref.py: Finds the NULL symbol of an IQ file, and runs
  correlations against the known phase reference to find the components

Example image: ![Example correlation](./example_corr.png)

The example image shows the correlation (horizontal: time delay, vertical:
time offset of the different pieces) between a simulated channel
and the phase reference.
The peaks at delay indices 0, 14 and 25 are clearly visible.

Next steps
----------
Read in a recording using a RTL-SDR receiver.


Requirements
------------
Python with NumPy and matplotlib

The iq files must be complex float or interleaved unsigned 8-bit.
